# Facial Stress Index Analyzer System (FSIA)

## PROJECT INTRODUCTION

In today's fast-paced world, stress has become an unavoidable part of daily life, affecting both mental and physical well-being. The Facial Stress Index Analyzer (FSIA) is designed to provide users with valuable insights into their stress patterns over time through routine use. By leveraging advancements in computer vision and machine learning, FSIA offers a non-invasive, convenient, and automated system for daily stress assessment through facial image analysis.

### Main Functionality:

1. **Facial Image Capture**: The system captures facial images using a standard camera.
2. **Real-time Analysis**: It analyzes the captured images in real-time to detect stress levels.
3. **Stress Level Pattern Analysis Over 30 Days**: It provides an overview of stress patterns over a 30-day period, helping users understand their stress trends and triggers.
